          According to a story, he decided to open the hotel after an incident involving racial discrimination at the Watson's Hotel in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel permitted only Europeans.
           Hotels that accepted only European guests were very common across British India then.
            According to another story, he opened the hotel when one of his friends expressed disgust over the hotels that were present in Bombay then.
             But a more plausible reason was advanced by Lovat Fraser, a close friend of the Tata and one of the early directors of the IHCL group, that the idea had long been in his mind and that he had made a study on the subject.
              He did not have any desire to own a hotel but he wanted to attract people to India and to improve Bombay.
